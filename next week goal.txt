- Implement end-to-end pipeline using the Go sample project that we have discussed in the class.
- Go through the documentation of `gitlab-ci.yml` file on gitlab.com documentation page
- Go through various variables available in the pipeline. Go through the documentation.

Deliverables:
- Everyone should have their own Go project in Gitlab.
- Everyone should create their own Pipeline in Gitlab.
- Arm Runners might not work unless you add your own runners. So you should make the ARM jobs "optional"
- Should be able to answer any questions about the Pipeline file.
